            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Exotic, and I have been playing Free Fire for 6 years. Over the past 4 years, I have competed in various esports tournaments, showcasing my skills and strategies.</p>
            <p>My favorite gun in the game was the M1887; it had a significant impact on my gameplay at the start. However, after it was nerfed, I switched to using the Charge Buster, which has become my go-to weapon in recent tournaments.</p>

            <h2>Teams</h2>
            <p>I started my journey with <strong>THE Guardians</strong>, where I learned the basics of competitive play. After that, I joined <strong>Savage Esports</strong>, which helped me refine my skills and take my gameplay to the next level. Eventually, I played for <strong>D-Champs</strong>, where I had some memorable matches.</p>
            <p>Currently, I participate in T3 scrims with <strong>Infire Esports</strong>, honing my abilities for upcoming competitions.</p>
